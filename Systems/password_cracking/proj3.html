<p>(project concept, portions of the writeup, and your generated executables thanks to Dr. Misurda.)</p>

<p>A great way to learn how something works is to <strong>break it.</strong> This is especially true for things where you don’t know <em>how</em> they work. Many of the things we know about biology, the universe, physics etc. come from seeing what happens when things go wrong.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to <strong>recover passwords - or password patterns - for three executable files.</strong> You <strong>don’t have the source code</strong> to these programs, only the compiled executable!</p>

<p>To make it more of a challenge, the programs <em>may</em> have a single, fixed password, or they <em>may</em> use some kind of algorithm to generate/check the password.</p>

<p class="important">Read this section before doing anything else!</p>

<p>Here’s how to set up <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code> to use the Intel disassembly syntax. While logged into thoth, do this:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pico ~/.gdbinit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Inside that file, write this exactly:</p>

<pre><code class="language-gdb">set disassembly-flavor intel
</code></pre>

<p>and save. Now, when you view disassembly in <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdb</code>, it will match the slides I gave you and will be way easier to understand overall.</p>

<h2 id="40-points-mystringsc">[40 points] <code class="highlighter-rouge">mystrings.c</code></h2>

<p>There are many tools that will be helpful for password-cracking. One is a program to extract <strong>readable strings</strong> from a binary file.</p>

<p>A binary file can contain text, but it will be embedded within a bunch of non-text data. Here’s a snippet of an example output of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">hexdump -C</code> command, which shows the bytes in hex on the left, and their ASCII version (or . if it’s not ASCII) on the right.</p>

<p>There is a UNIX program called <code class="highlighter-rouge">strings</code> which lets you search for strings within a binary file like this. You will write a little program called <code class="highlighter-rouge">mystrings</code> which will be a very simplified version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">strings</code>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-it-should-work">How it should work</h3>

<p>Your program will be <strong>very</strong> simple. Seriously. This can be done in about 30-40 lines of C, not counting braces.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">mystrings</code> will work as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You will run it like <code class="highlighter-rouge">./mystrings somefile</code>.</li>
  <li>It will read <code class="highlighter-rouge">somefile</code> as a <strong>binary</strong> file.
    <ul>
      <li>It should check if the file doesn’t exist, by seeing if <code class="highlighter-rouge">fopen</code> returned <code class="highlighter-rouge">NULL</code>. If so, print an error and quit.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It should look for sequences of 4 or more <strong>printable ASCII characters.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>It should print each of those sequences on its own line.</li>
      <li>A <strong>printable ASCII character</strong> is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">char</code> whose value is in the range 32 to 126, <strong>inclusive.</strong> So [32, 126].</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="requirements-and-tips">Requirements and Tips</h3>

<p>You <strong>don’t have to support</strong> any of the extra options that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">strings</code> program supports.</p>

<p>You <strong>don’t have to display tab and newline characters as embedded within strings, like <code class="highlighter-rouge">strings</code> does.</strong></p>

<p>The strings are <strong>not necessarily 0-terminated!</strong> They are terminated by <em>any</em> non-printable ASCII character. So, you can’t really use <code class="highlighter-rouge">printf("%s")</code>.</p>

<p>Make sure your program can handle strings that are <strong>arbitrarily long.</strong> Since you have no idea how long a string is when you start reading it, that means you can’t really allocate space to store the whole string.</p>

<p class="good-important">Fortunately, you only have to <strong><em>print</em></strong> ASCII characters until you hit the end. How many characters do you really have to <em>store?</em> Do you really need to store the string at all??</p>

<p>Try having a look at the functions in the C standard library, such as in <code class="highlighter-rouge">stdio.h</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">ctypes.h</code>. Maybe you’ll find something useful!</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="testing-it">Testing it</h3>

<p><strong>Do not run it on text files. That’s not what it’s for.</strong> Run it on binary files! Examples include executables, object files, image files, and more. There are lots of executables in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/bin</code>, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">/bin/ls</code>.</p>

<p>You can see what your program is <em>supposed</em> to output for a file by comparing its output to the output of the real <code class="highlighter-rouge">strings</code> program. I’ve made a shell script for you:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cp /afs/pitt.edu/home/j/f/jfb42/public/cs449/testmystrings.sh <span class="nb">.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Have a look inside it, and you will see that it runs both programs and <em>redirects</em> their output to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">strings.out</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">mystrings.out</code> files. Then it uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">git diff</code> to compare them.</p>

<p class="aside">The <code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt; strings.out</code> is <em>redirection</em> - it sends the output of the program to the file <code class="highlighter-rouge">strings.out</code> instead of to the console.</p>

<p>Now you can run it in the same directory as <code class="highlighter-rouge">mystrings</code> like:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./testmystrings.sh /bin/ls
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If it prints nothing, then the files are identical!</p>

<p><strong>Green lines</strong> mean your program is finding <em>too many</em> strings.</p>

<p><strong>Red lines</strong> mean your program is <em>missing</em> strings.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="60-points-password-cracking">[60 points] Password-cracking</h2>

<p>I have generated <strong>three executable files for each of you.</strong></p>

<p>Log into thoth. Then <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd /u/SysLab/yourusername</code>, like mine is <code class="highlighter-rouge">/u/SysLab/jfb42</code>. (The capitalization in <code class="highlighter-rouge">SysLab</code> is important.) There are your executables.</p>

<p class="note-important">The <code class="highlighter-rouge">/u/SysLab/</code> directory is physically stored on thoth. You cannot access it from any other computer, and any files you put in it will disappear at the end of the term when you lose access to thoth. It’s a better idea to do all your work in your AFS space.</p>

<p>So, <strong>copy the programs to your private directory</strong> by doing <code class="highlighter-rouge">cp * ~/private</code>. From there, you can do whatever you want with em.</p>

<h2 id="your-goal">Your goal</h2>

<p>When you run these executables, they wait for you to type something and hit enter. You must type the correct password to “unlock” them. The program will tell you whether or not you succeeded.</p>

<h2 id="oh-my-god-how-do-i-even-start">OH MY GOD HOW DO I EVEN START</h2>

<p>Reverse engineering is like a puzzle. You have to <strong>start with what you know.</strong> Here are some things to know:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>A program may have a *different password every time you run it!</em></strong> Make sure to test it several times, on different dates, from different computers etc.</li>
  <li>All the programs are <strong>written in C.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The assembly you look at was generated by an algorithm, so there is <em>structure</em> to it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Each program will have a different password <strong>per student,</strong> but <em>how to find it</em> will be the same for everyone.</li>
  <li>All passwords will be <strong>printable ASCII characters</strong> and be <strong>far less than 100 characters in length.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>That being said, brute-forcing will probably not be productive.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="good-important" style="font-size: 300%"><a href="proj3_details.html">Here is a page with a lot more info that might be helpful for you.</a></p>

<h2 id="the-writeup">The writeup</h2>

<p>You will be typing up a short document which shows, for each of the three programs:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the <strong>password</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>it might be a <strong>single fixed string</strong></li>
      <li>or it might be <strong>generated by an algorithm,</strong> in which case you must <strong>describe the algorithm</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>an explanation of <strong>how you found it</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>you don’t have to describe the <em>entire</em> process, but…</li>
      <li>briefly describe any <strong>failed attempts or ideas</strong></li>
      <li>and then describe <strong>how you succeeded.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>If you couldn’t find the password,</strong> you can still get full credit for this part of the writeup by explaining your attempts and your theories on what the password is.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>This is not a writing course. Please don’t write a novel. There is no page count to hit.</strong> It only has to be between 1 and 2 pages, line spacing 1.5, 12pt font, 1 inch margins.</p>

<p>Please keep it to-the-point and technical. You don’t need an intro and body and conclusion. Just write <strong>clearly and tersely.</strong> Technical writing is about <em>clarity.</em> (Humor and wit are still welcome, of course.)</p>
