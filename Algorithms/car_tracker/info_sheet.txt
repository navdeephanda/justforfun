Does your program run without error?: Y

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:







Additional comments to the grader:

*The solution may not be pretty, but to my knowledge, it meets all the stated requirements!
*You can ignore the code in the main() method of my CarOrganizer class, unless you're interested in it. It contains all the 
code I used to test my class.
*The PQs have a maximum capacity of 10,000, so if you try to add any more than that you'll error out the program.
