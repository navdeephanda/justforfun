Additional comments to the grader:

All of the source files were taken from the authors code, available on
the course website and through online searches. They were slightly modified
to fit the requirements of this project.

I also used the following sources in algorithm development:
http://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs2321/www/newLectures/30_More_Dijkstra.htm :to figure out how to use Dijkstra's algorithm on an undirected graph.
